<h2>Cute!</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Try to hit the man with cupid's arrow.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I hope they don't get too bored with my game. 
The players would learn to love colors!
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
This game fits into a kids genre.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
<li>1. Wait for the dogs to pop up.
<li>2. Avoid collision with the cats.
<li>3. Click on the dogs, they'll disappear.
<li>The character should be able to move left, right and jump.
The cats generate from the center of the screen while the dogs float up and down.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Catch as many hearts!
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Cool music and very colorful.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
</li>This game is abstract. 
Made in a make believe place located in the middle of no where.
The cupid is the only character that exists in this world.
So far, the character can't move, the cats spew out of no where, and the dogs float.
The cats and dogs are giants, while the character is minuscule in comparison.
There is no backstory and there are no tokens.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game is targeted for children 5 years old and under.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
The game is finished in like 20 - 30 seconds.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The player should first identify where the hearts are located.
Then when there's a large gap where there are no cats, quickly click on the dog.
Also, try to avoid your avatar from colliding with the cats.
You'll die, or at least I want it to happen, that's still a work in progress.
