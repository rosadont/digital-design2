</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>

</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
</li>This game is abstract. 
Made in a make believe place located in the middle of no where.
The policeman and criminal are the only character that exists in this world.
There is no backstory and there are no tokens.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game is targeted for children 5 years old and under.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
The game is finished in like 20 - 30 seconds.

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The player should first identify where the criminals are located, then where the man is.
Be quick about it and shoot them down.
You'll die if you touch them, or at least I want it to happen, that's still a work in progress.
